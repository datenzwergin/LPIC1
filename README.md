ict@innovation: Training Guide on Linux System Administration, LPI Certification Level 1 - Supporting African IT-enterprises to get Open Source skills and certification on level 1 of the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) Certification

# Who this guide is for
This guide was mainly written for African experts and institutions wanting to become qualified trainers
on the subject of Linux system administration. It is geared towards Trainers who want to incorporate
FOSS Certification training based on the Linux Professionals Institute (LPI) community certification
program into their institution's curriculum and/or developing FOSS Certification training as a new
revenue stream. This open training guide provides a structured set of learning modules with learning
objectives, key knowledge areas, introductions and concrete learning steps and handouts as well as a
module on how to be a FOSS trainer. The guide is therefore is particularly suitable for use in Training-
of-Trainers settings and the development of advanced courses within ICT-associations, their member
organisations, ICT-training institutions as well as universities. It can be used in tutored learning
environments (e.g. 2 weeks courses preparing for the certification exam) as well as other settings such
as peer-to-peer learning, self-study, blended learning and e-learning.
In addition, any learner anywhere in the world will find this guide useful for study and preparation of
the LPI certification. She or he will learn how to fulfil the first essential steps in becoming a Linux
System Administrator charged with installing, supporting, and maintaining Linux-based computer
systems.

The training guide builds on the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) community Certification as a world-
wide recognized distribution-neutral and vendor-neutral standard for evaluating the competency of
Linux professionals with the possibility to hold low-cost paper-based examinations. It has three levels.
The LPIC-1 (101 and 102 exams) level taught in this guide cover the fundamental Linux system
administration skills. Like the LPI curriculum itself, the course is "distribution neutral"; that is, it does
not favour a specific Linux distribution. Learners can therefore use this manual not only to pass the
LPIC-1 exams but also be in a position to operate a range of different Linux distributions. The detailed
objectives of LPI EXAM 101 AND 102 are online at:
http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview

Learners are expected to have:
- Extensive experience (several years) using computers, including a strong knowledge of
hardware components and their interaction with basic operating system (OS) components.
- A general knowledge of computing and networking basics such as binary and hexadecimal
maths, file-system structures, Ethernet and Internet networking operations and hardware, etc.
- More than three cumulative months of practical experience using a GNU/Linux, BSD or Unix
OS, working at the command-line (in a text terminal or console) either locally or remotely.

Those with less experience, however, should not be discouraged from using this guide, if (and only if)
they are willing to spend extra time catching up on the prerequisite background skills and knowledge;
a challenging task, but not an impossible one.
